# ds-opt
Toolbox including optimization techniques for estimation of Globally Asymptotically Stable Dynamical Systems focused on (1) Linear Parameter Varying formulation with GMM-based mixing function and different Lyapunov candidate functions as proposed in [1,2]. 
For comparison purposes, this toolbox also includes implementations and demo scripts for DS learning with SEDS [3] and the diffeomorphic matching approach [4].
