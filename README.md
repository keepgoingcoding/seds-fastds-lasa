# ds-opt
This toolbox includes the implementation of the estimation of Dynamical Systems formulated as Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) Systems with GMM-based mixing function and different Lyapunov candidate functions as proposed in [1].


### Comparison
We also include implementation and comparison scripts of the EM-based LPV-DS formulation proposed in [2] and SEDS [3].
